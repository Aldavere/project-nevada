Ok, so the last of the changes have been made. I think.

All the plugins should be up to date to each other, as well as to the most correct version of the file.

I think I've hit every major change that needed to be done. I've been going through and checking all the items. The included pndlctest.txt file can be used to obtain every single item affected by the PN patches (minus the cyberware stuff). I've been using this to systematically test every single feature and see what still needs to be done.

The readme has been updated to reflect all changes made, as well as to point out when items have been edited when it can't be helped (this is in OWB and LR).

The GRA Rebalance plugin handles adding the Rebalance knockdown effects to the explosives (that totally should have been a core feature), the DM Rebalance plugin handles the foods affected by the Old World Gourmet perk.

I'm pretty sure that all the explosives and such are in the correct categories, but someone should check on that for me.

Anything else I think is just polish, and I'm pretty happy with the changes I had so far. If anyone else has any ideas, add them here with your name attached, and I'll go over them tomorrow.
