This is an _UNOFFICIAL_ patcher that enables NVSR 4-1-28 to work with FalloutNV 1.4.0.525 (update 7).
It patches the addresses for all currently supported hooks in the nvsr.dll so they point to the right locatations again.
	
Will NVSR still work as it is supposed to? I don't know :) It starts without crashing and prints stuff to the log.
Beyond that, anything can happen. It may reduce stutter, it may increase stutter, it may make your computer explode.
Please be aware of that.

Installation:
	1. Install the New Vegas Stutter Remover 4-1-28
	2. Install this file in FOMM. It'll attempt to patch the NVSR.dll. If it failed, it will notify you.
	

Problems, Questions?
Feel free to send me a PM, but I probably won't be able to help you as I have no clue how exactly NVSR works and what it does.
This is really just a quick hack, either it works for you or it doesn't.
Also, please don't ask SkyRanger-1, the author of NVSR, any questions related to this patch.
