[size="6"][color="#FF8C00"][font="Courier New"][b]Introduction[/b][/font][/color][/size]

Project Nevada is a mod aiming to make Fallout: New Vegas a more interesting - eventually more challenging - but surely more fun
experience for you. Created by the team responsible for the Fallout 3 Wanderers Edition (FWE), we're leaving the barren DC wasteland
behind and move on west to new, exciting regions.

Project Nevada is not an overhaul, instead it's organized as a set of themed modules. Each module can address different aspects of the
game and target different audiences, but they are also designed to work in conjunction. Our vision is to allow players to pick the modules
they want and using them together with any mod they like, instead of forcing them to make the all-or-nothing choice. See the next sections
for detailed descriptions and features of all current modules.

Further general objectives and design concepts are:

[color="#FF8C00"]*[/color] Easy installation and setup; no load order or complicated dependencies.

[color="#FF8C00"]*[/color] Great customization through different modules and an ingame menu

[color="#FF8C00"]*[/color] Rather keep things straight forward and enjoyable than overly complicated and tedious.

[color="#FF8C00"]*[/color] Avoid changes that could conflict with other mods unless they are absolutely necessary.

[color="#FF8C00"]*[/color] Blend features in as good as possible - players shouldn't feel reminded that they're using a mod.

[color="#FF8C00"]*[/color] Polish, polish, polish.


[size="6"][color="#FF8C00"][font="Courier New"][b]Module Overview[/b][/font][/color][/size]

[size="5"][font="Courier New"][b][color="#FF8C00"]<[/color]Core[color="#FF8C00"]>[/color][/b][/font][/size]

The Core module is the foundation of Project Nevada, and as such required by all other modules.

It adds the gameplay features found in popular first-person-shooter games that were yet missing in New Vegas. Some of those features are
improved versions of already well-known features from FWE, like the Grenade Hotkey, Bullet Time or Sprint. All of them are rewritten from the 
ground up, with exciting new features like the support for several VATS perks in Bullet Time and support for throwing weapons with the
grenade hotkey. Others are brand new, like the Dynamic Crosshair that changes it size according to the current weapon spread. Each of
those features can be individually enabled or disabled in-game. They are fully script-based to play along well with other mods.

To allow customization, the Core module implements a Control Panel. For DarnUI users, it can be accessed directly from the pause menu.
Other mods may extend the Control Panel without conflict and make use of the provided methods for streamlined hotkey assignment.

Since the Core module avoids conflicting changes, players are free run it alongside any other mods, including their favorite overhaul.


[size="5"][font="Courier New"][b][color="#FF8C00"]<[/color]Rebalance[color="#FF8C00"]>[/color][/b][/font][/size]

This module aims to bring back the challenge and balance known from Fallout3 Wanderers Edition and includes many tweaks to the FNV 
gameplay and difficulty. Combat will be quicker and deadlier and survival much harder. These changes are aimed to be very subtle and 
non-intrusive, making the game more challenging without inconveniencing the player.


[size="5"][font="Courier New"][b][color="#FF8C00"]<[/color]Cyberware[color="#FF8C00"]>[/color][/b][/font][/size]

Even though humanity nuked itself back into the Stone Age, you don't have to fight with sticks and stones. Some of mans most
advanced technological creations have been preserved - and the Cyberware module gives you the chance to obtain them!

Practically this means new features are associated with cybernetic implants and high-tech equipment. Examples include enhanced
vision modes for power armor helmets and bionic legs allowing you to charge towards your enemies with super-human speed.

While for equipment existing items are used, the cybernetic implants come with a custom interface to attach and manage them.
The whole system is balanced by several mechanisms, like limiting the number of implants that can be attached at the same time, or
requiring energy supply for special equipment.


[size="5"][font="Courier New"][b][color="#FF8C00"]<[/color]Equipment[color="#FF8C00"]>[/color][/b][/font][/size]

The Equipment module brings new weapons and armor to the Mojave Wasteland.
Source of these items are the many excellent creations produced by the modding community, as well as those created by our own team.

We aim to include only weapons and armor of high quality that fit well within the New Vegas environment and the Fallout universe in general.
To ensure a seamless integration, the new items are carefully balanced and placed at appropriate locations, including vendors and loot lists.
