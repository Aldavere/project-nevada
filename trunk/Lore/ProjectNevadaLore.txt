Project Nevada: The Last Greatest American

The Story:

Representives from several countries form the Admirality Board of a Group known as;

Our Lady Majestic, or The Olm, or simply "Majestic"

The Majestic's Headquarters is a combination of all the world's government knowledge,
uncaring of petty things like patriotism, they were simply loyal to one cause.

The advancement of human technology, and humanity as a whole.

Around 2055 there were seven admirals from various government bodies, each with codenames derived from
various world firearms.

The seven knew of the changes in times, globally, and prepared a plan to carry out their existence
in the event of nuclear war. The project estimated that the mojave, specifically Las Vegas, Neveda...
was the safest place to carry out the project, which would hence forth be known as...

Project NEVADA.

They would distribute their technologies using automated processes, packages, and control groups
before, during, and after, to make sure that the technology created by the majestic would root itself
to the people of post-apocolyptic earth, the mojave wasteland specifically, and that they would
come out of advanced statis to rebuild the world with the one their technology would choose as a patron
and master of human technology. A master to rebuild the world, for our lady majestic.
