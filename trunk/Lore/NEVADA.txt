Cornerstones:

- Recoverability

Installation of a NEVADA-certified implant does not require in any permanent alterations in the users body.
This includes the possibility to remove it again. While at first sounding like a serious limitation, this 
contraint comes with several advantages, i.e. higher public acceptance, flexible business models (leasing),
and a lower risk of fatal malfunctions.


- Interoperability

Unless explicitely stated, implants constructed according to the NEVADA standards can co-exist in the same body
without interference.


- Unification

While all NEVADA members pursue their own goals and interests, non-competitive areas are standardized by the group.
As a result, the required training time for medical personnel is highly reduced. Costs are further reduced by allowing
to use a common set of tools and devices for all implants.
